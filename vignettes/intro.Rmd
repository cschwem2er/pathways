This app enables interactive exploration of the **Pathways Corpus** for studying the political representation of Citizens of Immigrant Origin. It includes parliamentary written questions from democracies of eight European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

## No active maintenance

Please note that this packages is not actively maintained any longer. The datasets will be functional in the future, but the corpus explorer may not work anymore.

## How to Install

You can download and install the latest development version of the app with the devtools package by running ``devtools::install_github('cschwem2er/pathways')``.    

For Windows users installing from github requires proper setup of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

At the moment, pathways is not yet available on CRAN, but a submission is being prepared.

## How to Use


This package includes all datasets of the Pathways Corpus:

```{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
name <- c('be', 'de', 'el', 'es', 'fr', 'it', 'nl', 'uk')
country <- c('Belgium', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Spain', 'France', 'Italy', 'Netherlands', 'United Kingdom')
term <- c('2010-2014', '2009-2013', '2015', '2011-2015', '2007-2012', '2008-2013', '2010-2012', '2010-2015')
df <- data.frame(name, country, term)
knitr::kable(df)
```

Parliamentary written questions are stored in a data frame for each country with all textual data encoded as 'UTF-8'. Here are some questions including metadata for the German Bundestag, 2009-2013:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(pathways)
head(de)
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(pathways)
df <- head(de, 3)
```


```{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}

knitr::kable(df)
```


After loading the pathways package you can launch the shiny app in your browser to explore the corpus:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
corpus_explorer()
```

The app can be used to filter corpora by several attributes and for visualizing high frequency / high keyness terms:
